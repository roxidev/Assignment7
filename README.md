## Managed the state in this assignment project.

In your "Course Registration" React project, state is managed using the useState hook for the following variables:

remaining: Represents the remaining course credits that a student can register for. It is updated when a course is registered or dropped.

totalCredit and totalPrice: Track the total number of credits and the total price of registered courses. They are updated as courses are registered or dropped.

title: Represents the title of the course registration page or form and can be updated if needed. These state variables help keep track of important information and provide a user-friendly course registration experience in your project.
